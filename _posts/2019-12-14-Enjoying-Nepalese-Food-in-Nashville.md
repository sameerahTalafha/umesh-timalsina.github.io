Neplaese food in many ways is similar to Indain Food, but way less spicy and healthier in my view. Ask anybody from Nepal, she/he will tell you that you should try mo: mo:, a go to dumpling that is very popular in Nepal and North East India. If you are in Nashville and want to check out what Nepalese food tastes like, I recommend checking out [Everest Restaurant and Bar

I moved to Nashville in June of 2019. Since then, I have been exploring various avenues to satiate my recent found curiosity for food around the world. I don't know if it is the fact that I am a vegeterian that causes me to explore various options to find a right amount of vegeterian options in the menu or I just enjoy knowing what people consume around the world. Either ways, its been fun exploring various restaurants in and around Nashville. But, nothing feeds your tastebuds better than the food from back home (ask any immigrant, you will know). Luckily, for me there's an option, the option to enjoy momos, a version of Nepalese dumplings that in my view are the best dumplings. Or, enjoy a vegeterian thali, or a nice hot plate of chow-mein (the go to afternoon snack). 

## Eating Habits in Nepal
If you are from any part of the Indian sub-continent, you will know that, the carbs we consume primarily come from rice and wheat. In Nepal, its no different. While, so much has changed in couple of decades, I still consider Nepalese society to be mostly agrarian. Sure we don't have commerical agriculture that stands out in terms of revenue or the products we export. Most of the food we eat grow in our kitchen garden and small patch of land that belongs to the family. Most of vegetables we consume come from the kitchen gardens and is organic. One thing that's sort of inarguable is that, most of the cooking happens around fresh, organic food that is really healthy.

Sure, times have changed and what I stated before is no longer the case in most cities and even small towns in the country as dependence on remittances from the the middle-east and  However, the culture of growing food for your family and selling what's leftover is predominant in most parts of the country. Its almost a part and parcel of day to day life in Terai.
